The Micro Python board
======================

The Micro Python board (pyboard) is a small microcontroller board
that runs Micro Python.  It is based on the STM32F405RGT6 MCU and
includes USB, a micro SD card slot and an accelerometer.

This repository contains the schematic, gerbers, EAGLE files, BOM
and assembly guide for PYBv3 (the 3rd revision of the board).

Development of the next revision of the board, PYBv4, is a top
priority, and must be completed by mid-January 2014.

The main aim for PYBv4 is to allow for the addition of skins
(add-on modules) whilst retaining the form-factor and functionality
of PYBv3.

The wiki for this repository contains the plans and discussion for
PYBv4.  Feel free to contribute to the discussion, and open any
issues for specific items.
